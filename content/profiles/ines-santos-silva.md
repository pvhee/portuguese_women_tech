###### Early years and where you came from?

I was born in a small village close to Porto and at 18 I went to the University of Porto to study Management. Back then, I dreamt with a job at Goldman Sachs in New York, but life changed dramatically and I ended up falling in love with startups.

###### How were you introduced to the world of tech?

I always knew I was somehow geeky. I was always looking for new gadgets and in my teenage years, I spent more hours that I like to admit playing PlayStation, GameBoy and computer. My summer holidays and weekends were spent between books (I love to read) and video games.
However, my real introduction to tech happen when I was in college. In 2007, I joined FEP Junior Consulting (student-led organization that does consultancy work) and I had my first contact with incubators and startups. Then, through a series of lucky moments, I ended up organizing Barcamp Porto in 2010 and that’s where I fell in love with technology and entrepreneurship. Since then, everything I’ve done has been driven by curiosity and a deep passion for connecting people and ideas.

###### Walk me through your work and what you are doing now.

I’m the growth lead at TOPDOX, a Porto-based startup. TOPDOX is the easiest way to get things done on mobile. Through one single app, you can access, read, edit & share any document, anywhere. Even offline. At TOPDOX, I spend my days talking with users, defining and implementing marketing and communication strategies and analysing data. On the side, I’m actively involved in the Portuguese startup scene and I like to think of myself as an unofficial ambassador for the Portuguese startup ecosystem abroad.

###### What part of what you do, you love the most?

I love connecting people and ideas.

###### How do you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you

approach your work?
Because of my non-technical background, it’s easier for me to put aside the technicalities of building a product and focus on the impact that product will have in the user’s life.

###### What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and

don’t know where to start?
Start attending tech meetups like Porto/Minho/Coimbra Startup Coffee, BREAK, Girls Lean in or Portugal Girl Geek Dinners. Get actively involved by adding value to the other participants and by helping out the organizers. After that, things will just happen.

###### Walk me through a day in your life.

I wake up at 7:30am full of energy. No matter at what time I wake up or how many hours of sleep I have, I always wake up energized. I usually leave my house to work around 8:30am. On most days, I have early morning skype calls with friends living abroad or with startups and other entrepreneurship organizations. I do a lot of informal mentoring these days. Then I start working around 9:30 am until 7pm. I have a short break for lunch around 2pm and usually that’s the only break I take. My days at TOPDOX are very diversified. Sometimes I work on collecting and analysing data, other times I do content marketing, other times I do business development & sales, etc. After leaving I either go home and have dinner, or I stay close to the office and work on some side projects. It can be writing a blog post, preparing for a talk, putting together my monthly newsletter or develop some ideas. Sometimes, I have a few more calls before going home. When I get home I try to read as much as possible. Reading (listen to interesting podcasts and watching videos) is a priority for me because it’s the only way to get better at my job. I go to bed around 12:30am.

###### What's the best advice you've ever received?

I honestly don’t know. What I do know is that a lot of what I am was influenced by the examples of my parents and grandmother. Since a young age, I was incentive to work hard, stay curious and never give up.

###### What apps/software/tools can't you live without?

On a very practical level I can’t live without Gmail,  Sunrise and TOPDOX. These 3 apps run my life. Gmail to connect with people. Sunrise to make sure I don’t forget any appointment. TOPDOX to access & edit my documents wherever they are. Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn are also super important to me.
